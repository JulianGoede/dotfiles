# dotfiles

Once working with many tools (e.g. vim,zsh,bash etc.) it's easy to loose track of their
configuration files. In order to both save and effectively manage your dotfiles, store them
in a vcs-repo. *Note* that you shouldn't store your secret credentials (e.g. ssh-privatekey,
aws-secretkey), not even in a private repo.
